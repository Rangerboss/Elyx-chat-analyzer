[3/13/25, 7:00 AM] Rohan: Advik, my Garmin shows HR spikes during sleep. Normal?

[3/13/25, 7:15 AM] Advik (Performance): Data suggests elevated HRV strain. Could be late meals or stress. Did you eat after 10 PM?

[3/13/25, 7:20 AM] Rohan: Yes, had noodles at midnight.

[3/13/25, 7:30 AM] Advik (Performance): That explains it. Let’s track food timing vs HRV.

[3/15/25, 8:00 PM] Rohan: Carla, can I keep having morning lattes with sugar? Or do I have to stop?

[3/15/25, 8:15 PM] Carla (Nutrition): Let’s cut added sugar. Switch to unsweetened almond milk latte. Supports blood sugar stability.

[3/15/25, 8:20 PM] Rohan: Fine, I’ll try.

[3/17/25, 6:45 AM] Rohan: Rachel, hotel gym in Jakarta has only light dumbbells. What do I do?
